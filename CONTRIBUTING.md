# Contributing

First of all, thanks for contributing!

This document provides some basic guidelines for contributing to this repository.
To propose improvements, feel free to submit a PR or open an Issue.

## Development Environment

You need [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) and Xcode (_preferably one of the last versions_).

### Preparing The Repo

To prepare the repo for development after fresh clone, run `make` in the root folder:
```bash
$ make
```
This will install necessary tools and fetch required dependencies.

### Writting Code and Tests

After fetching new commit, you may need to run `pod install` in `Example` folder if dependencies were upgraded on remote.

To work on the `DatadogSDKBridge` pod open `Example/DatadogSDKBridge.xcworkspace` in Xcode. This workspace includes two projects:
```
DatadogSDKBridge
 - Podspec Metadata
 - Tests
 - ...

Pods
 - Development Pods
   - DatadogSDKBridge
 - Pods
   - ...
```
* Write code in `Pods > Development Pods > DatadogSDKBridge`.
* Write tests in `DatadogSDKBridge > Tests`.
* Run tests with `âŒ˜ + U`.

## Submitting Issues

Many great ideas for new features come from the community, and we'd be happy to
consider yours!

To share your request, you can open an [issue](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-bridge-ios/issues/new) 
with the details about what you'd like to see. At a minimum, please provide:

 - The goal of the new feature;
 - A description of how it might be used or behave;
 - Links to any important resources (e.g. Github repos, websites, screenshots,
     specifications, diagrams).

## Found a bug?

For any urgent matters (such as outages) or issues concerning the Datadog service
or UI, contact our support team via https://docs.datadoghq.com/help/ for direct,
faster assistance.

You may submit bug reports concerning the Datadog Bridge for iOS by 
[opening a Github issue](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-bridge-ios/issues/new).
At a minimum, please provide:

 - A description of the problem;
 - Steps to reproduce;
 - Expected behavior;
 - Actual behavior;
 - Errors (with stack traces) or warnings received;
 - Any details you can share about your configuration including:
    - affected iOS version(s)
    - Datadog Bridge version
    - Versions of any other relevant dependencies (e.g: Alamofire, etc.)

If at all possible, also provide:

 - Logs (from the tracer/application/agent) or other diagnostics;
 - Screenshots, links, or other visual aids that are publicly accessible;
 - Code sample or test that reproduces the problem;
 - An explanation of what causes the bug and/or how it can be fixed.

Reports that include rich detail are better, and ones with code that reproduce
the bug are best.

## Have a patch?

We welcome code contributions to the library, which you can 
[submit as a pull request](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-bridge-ios/pull/new/main).
Before you submit a PR, make sure that you first create an Issue to explain the
bug or the feature your patch covers, and make sure another Issue or PR doesn't
already exist.

To create a pull request:

1. **Fork the repository** from https://github.com/DataDog/dd-bridge-ios ;
2. **Make changes** for your patch;
3. **Write tests for it**
4. **Update related parts of the documentation**
5. **Submit your pull request to the upstream**

The pull request will be run through our CI pipeline, and a project member will
review the changes with you. At a minimum, to be accepted and merged, pull
requests must:

 - Have a stated goal and detailed description of the changes made;
 - Include thorough test coverage and documentation, where applicable;
 - Pass all tests and code quality checks (linting/coverage/benchmarks) on CI;
 - Receive at least one approval from a project member with push permissions.

Make sure that your code is clean and readable, that your commits are small and
atomic, with a proper commit message. We tend to use 
[gitmoji](https://gitmoji.carloscuesta.me/), but this is **not** mandatory.

## Coding

### Constraints

`DatadogSDKBridge` is designed to be called from non-native-iOS platforms, such as ReactNative, etc.
Although it's written in Swift, it should be as close to ObjC as possible in order to avoid friction.

**Example**: If `DatadogSDKBridge` uses Swift-only types in its API then that type needs to be converted to an ObjC type in all of its callers (e.g: ReactNative, etc.) and this will possibly lead to code duplication in the big picture.

### Conventions

Regarding coding style: `DatadogSDKBridge.xcworkspace` runs `swiftlint` as a `Build phase` step. Please make sure linter doesn't have warnings or errors before raising your PR.
